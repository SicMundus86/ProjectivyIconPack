## 🔴 About Projectivy Icon Pack

The **Projectivy Icon Pack** is designed specifically for use with the Projectivy Launcher application.  

Created and based on the [Blueprint project](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/Blueprint)—which made the icon pack possible—it’s easy to apply, with icons configured to automatically assign to all supported applications, saving you the time and effort of manually selecting icons for each app.

All icons are **custom-made** to deliver a modern and consistent look, with **transparent backgrounds** that enhance visual consistency and allow you to assign your preferred background colors in the launcher.  

> **Tip:** For the best results, it’s recommended to use a **dark background for icons**, as the icons are designed to look their best on darker backgrounds.

> **Note:** The Projectivy icon pack is designed and tested using Android / Google TV. If you are using a TV device that is running a mobile variant not designed for TVs, some icons may not auto-assign due to some applications using different activities for mobile operating systems. In this scenario, you may have to assign them manually.

## 🔴 Requesting New Icons

If you notice that an icon is missing for an application that is compatible with TV devices, you can submit a request for it to be added to the Projectivy Icon Pack [**here**](https://github.com/SicMundus86/ProjectivyIconPack/issues/new/choose).  

Before submitting a request, please check that the icon is not already included in the pack or has not already been requested. A full list of supported application icons can be found [**here**](https://github.com/SicMundus86/ProjectivyIconPack/blob/main/Icons/IconPackList.md).

> **Note:** Whilst we aim to fulfil all requests, there is no guarantee that every request will be completed, and no specific timeframe can be provided for when requested icons may be added.

## 🔴 Automatic icon mapping issues.

Whilst I’ve taken extra care to map and test each icon, there is always the possibility that something may have been missed. If you notice that any applications do not automatically have their icons assigned, first ensure that you are running the latest version of the application and have restarted your device. If the issue still persists, please raise a mapping issue [**here**](https://github.com/SicMundus86/ProjectivyIconPack/issues/new/choose).  

> **Note:** Mapping is only configured and tested on android/google tv devices. Devices running unofficial mobile variants wont be officially supported, but I will still asisst as much as possible.

## 🔴 Requesting Icon Improvements

Not all icons are perfect, and sometimes a better design can enhance the overall look and feel of the app. If you’ve discovered or created a design that you believe improves an existing icon, please create a ticket and attach an image of the proposed icon, ensuring that it is of high quality, clear, and sharp. You can submit an icon improvement request [**here**](https://github.com/SicMundus86/ProjectivyIconPack/issues/new/choose).  

> **Note:** Icon improvement requests are considered a lower priority than requests for new icons. Not all improvement suggestions may be accepted, as they can be based on personal preference and may not actually be an improvement.

## 🔴 Troubleshooting

There are a couple of small squirks that are out of my control as its down to the launcher's behavior, but they are easy to work around and wont cause too much of an issue.

- ***"I have applied the icon pack for the first time and my old icons are still showing".***

This will happen if you've manually assigned your own icons to each application. The icon pack won't override these so you will need to manually reset the icon for each application.
  
- ***"New icons added to the icon pack are not assigned to my apps".***
  
When updating the icon pack, new icons may not be visibly assigned to applications. You will need to apply the icon pack again following the steps in the "how to download and install" section of this document.

- ***"Updated icons are not showing. I still see the old revisions".***

On occasion after updating the icon pack, the projectivy launcher cache may still show older icons of those icons that were replaced with improved versions. Restarting your device should solve this.

- ***"Icons against applications in the "all apps" menu have the incorrect icons next to them".***   

I feel this may be a bug with the launcher itself. After applying/updating the icon pack, on occasion the projectivy launcher cache may show the wrong icons against applications in the "all apps" menu. Restarting your device should solve this.

- ***"One of my apps just updated, and now the icon has reset and the app won’t open."***

This happens because the app developer changed the apps  activity, so the icon is still mapped to an activity that no longer exists within the application. I've mentioned this to the projectivy dev, so hopefully it will be something that can be fixed in the launcher.

### To fix it:

1. **Remove the app from your category**  
   – Go into your category list and delete the app entry.  

2. **Add it back again**  
   – The application should now open correctly.  
   – You can manually reassign the icon if needed.  

3. **Raise a mapping issue on GitHub**  
   – Report the issue so the auto-mapping can be updated and restored in future releases.

## 🔴 Donating

[![Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://buymeacoffee.com/sicmundus)

The Projectivy Icon Pack will always remain free for everyone to enjoy. That said, creating custom icons and mapping them to the right app activities can be a little time-consuming. While donations are never expected, a small gesture is always appreciated for the time and effort that goes into keeping the pack fresh and updated.
Your support helps keep me motivated to continue adding new icons and fulfilling icon requests,so the pack can keep growing and improving for all users. If you’d like to buy me a coffee, it would mean a lot, but just using and enjoying the icon pack is already awesome in itself.
