## üî¥ About Projectivy Icon Pack

The **Projectivy Icon Pack** is designed specifically for use with the Projectivy Launcher application.  

Created and based on the [Blueprint project](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/Blueprint)‚Äîwhich made the icon pack possible‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to apply, with icons configured to automatically assign to all supported applications, saving you the time and effort of manually selecting icons for each app.

All icons are **custom-made** to deliver a modern and consistent look, with **transparent backgrounds** that enhance visual consistency and allow you to assign your preferred background colors in the launcher.  

> **Tip:** For the best results, it‚Äôs recommended to use a **dark background for icons**, as the icons are designed to look their best on darker backgrounds.

> **Note:** The Projectivy icon pack is designed and tested using Android / Google TV. If you are using a TV device that is running a mobile variant not designed for TVs, some icons may not auto-assign due to some applications using different activities for mobile operating systems. In this scenario, you may have to assign them manually.

## üî¥ Requesting New Icons

If you notice that an icon is missing for an application that is compatible with TV devices, you can submit a request for it to be added to the Projectivy Icon Pack [**here**](https://github.com/SicMundus86/ProjectivyIconPack/issues/new/choose).  

Before submitting a request, please check that the icon is not already included in the pack. A full list of supported application icons can be found [**here**](https://github.com/SicMundus86/ProjectivyIconPack/blob/main/Icons/IconPackList.md).

## üî¥ Requesting Icon Improvements

Not all icons are perfect, and sometimes a better design can enhance the overall look and feel of the app. If you‚Äôve discovered or created a design that you believe improves an existing icon, please create a ticket and attach an image of the proposed icon, ensuring that it is of high quality, clear, and sharp. You can submit an icon improvement request [**here**](https://github.com/SicMundus86/ProjectivyIconPack/issues/new/choose).  

> **Note:** Icon improvement requests are considered a lower priority than requests for new icons. Not all improvement suggestions may be accepted, as they can be based on personal preference and may not actually be an improvement.

## üî¥ Troubleshooting / known issues

There are a couple of small squirks that are out of my control as its down to the launcher, but they are easy to work around and wont cause too much of an issue.

1. When updating the icon pack, new icons may not be visibly assinged to applications. You will need to apply the icon pack again following the steps in the "how to download and install" section of this document.
2. On occasion after updating the icon pack, the projectivy launcher cache may still show older icons of those icons that were replaced with improved versions. Restarting your device should solve this.
3. After applying/updating the icon pack, on occasion the projectivy launcher cache may show the wrong icons against applications in the "all apps" section. Restarting your device should solve this.

## üî¥ Donating

[![Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://buymeacoffee.com/sicmundus)

The Projectivy Icon Pack will always remain free for everyone to enjoy. That said, creating custom icons and mapping them to the right app activities can be a little time-consuming. While donations are never expected, a small gesture is always appreciated for the time and effort that goes into keeping the pack fresh and updated.
Your support helps keep me motivated to continue adding new icons and fulfilling icon requests,so the pack can keep growing and improving for all users. If you‚Äôd like to buy me a coffee, it would mean a lot, but just using and enjoying the icon pack is already awesome in itself.
