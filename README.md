## ðŸ”´ About Projectivy Icon Pack

The **Projectivy Launcher Icon Pack** is designed specifically for use with the Projectivy Launcher application.  
Created and based on the **Blueprint project**, which made the icon pack possible, itâ€™s easy to apply, with icons automatically assigned to all supported applications â€” saving you the time and effort of manually selecting icons for each app.

All icons are **custom-made** to deliver a modern and consistent look, with **transparent backgrounds** that enhance visual consistency and allow you to assign your preferred background colours in the launcher.  

> **Tip:** For the best results, itâ€™s recommended to use a **dark background for icons**, as the icons are designed to look their best on darker backgrounds.

## ðŸ”´ Requesting Icons

If you notice that an icon is missing for an application that is compatible with TV devices, you can submit a request for it to be added to the Projectivy Icon Pack [**here**](https://github.com/SicMundus86/ProjectivyIconPack/issues/new/choose).  

Whilst we aim to fulfil all requests, there is no guarantee that every request will be completed, and no specific timeframe can be provided for when requested icons may be added.  

Before submitting a request, please check that the icon is not already included in the pack. A full list of supported application icons can be found [**here**](https://github.com/SicMundus86/ProjectivyIconPack/blob/main/Icons/IconPackList.md)

## ðŸ”´ Troubleshooting / known issues

There are a couple of small squirks that are out of my control as its down to the launcher, but they are easy to work around and wont cause too much of an issue.

1. When updating the icon pack, new icons may not be visibly assinged to applications. You will need to apply the icon pack again following the steps in the "how to download and install" section of this document.

## ðŸ”´ Donating

[![Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/YOURUSERNAME)

The Projectivy Launcher Icon Pack will always remain free for everyone to enjoy. That said, creating custom icons and mapping them to the right app activities can be a little time-consuming. While donations are never expected, a small gesture is always appreciated for the time and effort that goes into keeping the pack fresh and updated.
Your support helps keep me motivated to continue adding new icons and fulfilling icon requests â€” so the pack can keep growing and improving for all users. If youâ€™d like to buy me a coffee, it would mean a lot, but just using and enjoying the icon pack is already awesome in itself.
